Your task is to do the following:
1. Create a Menu class with properties, constructors, and fields.

2. Create a MenuRepository class that has methods needed.

3. Create Test Class for repository methods. (You don't need to test
your constructors or objects. Just the methods.)

4. Create a Program file that allows the restaurant manager to:

see all items in the menu list.

Notes:
We don't need to update the items right now.
